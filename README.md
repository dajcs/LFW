Lens Flare Wizard

The aim of this project is to write a python script which will generate Lens Flare effects and apply them on top of existing images with the intent to create a training set of images with and without Lens Flare effects to be used in training a Computer Vision model.

The Lens Flare effects will be generated by Blender using the [Flares Wizard](https://blendermarket.com/products/flares-wizard) add-on.
